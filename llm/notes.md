Some notes arising from a meeting, Lex and Nick meeting 28 November 2024.

Research Questions

1) How do we define gentrification for an input some kind of machine classification?

2) How can we identify gentrification sentiment in SM / reviews? Filter for key terms?
- What are they ?
- From the literature?
- LLM could tells us We could ask ChatGPT for prompts

3) Can we identify gentrification sentiment in tweets / other SM data using LLMs?
-	How much training / prompting does it need?
-	Do the results replicate?

4) What are the relative benefits of the 70gb llama over 7gb llama (for example)?
-	Consistency of response?
-	Depth of response?
-	Nuance, Detail,  Sensitivity of the response?

Ideas: 
- Comparison of longer / shorter prompts against different LLM size
- Use / pay for Amazon Mechanical Turk to manually classify tweets into Gentrification / Not Gentrification with the prompt "does this tweet tell you something about gentrification or not?"
- Examine larger amounts of text: Perhaps use Open AirBnB to examine AirBnB reviews?

Actions: Parallel workflows to examine the above questions 
-	Nick examining longer texts (reviews etc)
-	Lex examining tweets
