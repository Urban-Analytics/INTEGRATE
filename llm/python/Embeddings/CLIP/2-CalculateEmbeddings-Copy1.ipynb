    "# Estimating Gentrification using Street View Images and Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "This script (initially produced by ChatGPT) does the following (_this was my query_):\n",
    " - Read a spatial boundary file (that I will hard code)\n",
    " - Obtain the road network (from OSM?) for that area\n",
    " - Generate sample points on the road network roughly X meters apart\n",
    " - At each sample point, download the most recent street images for that location (either a single 360 degree view of a few smaller images). Use whichever API service is the most appropriate for obtaining the images. Importantly please record the date that the image was taken.\n",
    " - For each image, calculate an embedding using an appropriate foundation model (one that has been pre-trained to distinguish street environments specifically). Please use Hugging Face libraries.\n",
    " - If necessary, calculate the mean embedding for each point (is this the best way to calculate a single embedding for a point represented by multiple images?)\n",
    " - Now, for each sampled point there will be a dataframe with information about the point and its embedding. Read another polygon spatial data file, that I will provide, which contains area-level estimates of gentrification.\n",
    " - Use point-in-polygon to get the gentrification for each point.\n",
    " - Use cross-validation to train a couple of ML models (probaly random forest, linear regression and a neural network) to estimate gentrification from the embedding vectors\n",
    " - Choose the best model and parameter configuration and test this model on some held-out data."
