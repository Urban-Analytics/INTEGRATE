All the utilities and internet are included for the first 3 months. This is a great hotel alternative. We look forward to hosting your stay whether for business or pleasure! This building borders several neighborhoods including Nob Hill, Union Square, FiDi, and the Tenderloin. That being said, there are also many famous tourist attractions close by such as the cable cars and Ferry Building. There is a great mall nearby called the West Field Shopping Center. Some of our favorite restaurants and bars within walking distance include Brenda's French Soul Food, Borobudur (Indonesian) and Bourbon and Branch (an original speakeasy).'\n",
