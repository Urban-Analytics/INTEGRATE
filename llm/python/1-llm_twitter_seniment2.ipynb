    " - Version 2 (this version) uses a new dataset that isn't from kaggle. This depricates the need for the code that downloads and reads the kaggle data. (This version will probably replace version 1)\n",

    "\n",
    "The accuracy of the prediction is only ~60%. BUT I think this is more about the task of sentiment classification being really hard. In many cases the LLM gets the sentiment prediction 'wrong', but I might actually agree with the LLM over the human-estimated sentiment score. If nothing else, this code is useful as a means of demonstrating how to use the Together.AI API to send batches of textx and get responses.   "
