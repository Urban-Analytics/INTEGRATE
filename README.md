# INTEGRATE

Integrated Analysis of Social Media and Hedonic House Prices for Neighbourhood Change

Main website: https://urban-analytics.github.io/INTEGRATE

## Repository structure 

 - [`llm`](./llm): code and writing for the work on detecting emerging gentrification with large language models (LLMs).
 - [`web`](./web): the files for the website are in jupyter book format, stored in this directory. There are files in the [`.github/workflows`](.github/workflows) directory that control how the website is built.


## Project Overview

This research project aims to develop innovative methods for analysing changes in
neighbourhoods over time and space by combining social media data (SMD) with hedonic house
price models (HHPMs). It does this through three parallel global case studies (in the UK, New
Zealand, and Vietnam). Evaluation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of perceived local
neighbourhood as captured through SMD and identification of the emergence of housing bubbles
and gentrification in these, will allow cross-cultural socio-economic and linguistic differences to be
identified and explored. Of particular interest is in how generifying process manifest themselves in
these different settings, how they are captured or not in social media posts, and what this implies
for approaches employing text engineering and natural language processing to different social
media and linguistic contexts.
