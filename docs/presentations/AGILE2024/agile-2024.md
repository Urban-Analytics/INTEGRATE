**Abstract**: This paper explore the use social media data from Twitter to capture perceptions of neighbourhood characteristics, in relation to gentrification. It does this by defining a rudimentary lexicon of words associated with gentrification. This was used to calculate gentrification scores for geo-located tweets. These were then
interpolated to create the surfaces in to determine spatial and temporal patterns of gentrification. There
are a number of limitations to the methods used in this study, which are discussed and a number of related
areas of future work are indicated.
