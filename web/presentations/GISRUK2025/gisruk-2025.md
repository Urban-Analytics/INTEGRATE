# Presentations at GISRUK 2025 in Bristol

[Geographical Information Science Research UK (GISRUK)](https://gisruk.org/) is a community of academics and practitioners whose mission is the advancement of spatial sciences and the nurturing of the next-generation spatial experts. The 33rd annual conference took place from 23rd to 27th April 2025 at the University of Bristol, England. 

Nick presented the following paper:

_Malleson, N., Quang, T. B., Nguyen Thi Thuy, H., Hoang Huu, P., Kieu, M., Asher, M., Wang, Y., & Comber, A. (2025, April 16). Using Large Language Models to Predict Neighbourhood Change. 33rd Annual GIS Research UK Conference (GISRUK), University of Bristol, UK. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15231204_

**Abstract**: This paper uses a large-language model (LLM) to read user-contributed text data – in this case property listings on Airbnb – and assign a score to indicate the degree to which the property’s neighbourhood is potentially undergoing gentrification. Preliminary results for a case study in Bristol are evaluated. These scores will ultimately be used as an input in a model of dynamic spatio-temporal neighbourhood change with the aims of (i) quantifying the impact that neighbourhood reputation has on historical house prices and (ii) predicting the emergence
of new house price bubbles.

Lex presented the following paper:

_Comber, A., Asher, M., Wang, Y., Le Kieu, M., Quang, T., Nguyen Thi, H., Hoang Huu, P., & Malleson, N. (2025, April 15). Using house sales transactions data to identify potentially gentrifying neighbourhoods. 33rd Annual GIS Research UK Conference (GISRUK), University of Bristol, UK. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15225193_

**Abstract**: This paper describes initial work seeking to identify locales of neighbourhood gentrification. It summarises house sales transactions over MSOAs, compares average annual house price with
neighbouring areas over a 10 year period, and uses a time series analysis to identify neighbourhoods with high rates of change of these as potential gentrifying neighbourhoods. The next steps are to link to analyses of social media data to characterise the nature of the observed neighbourhood change. A number of areas of further work are described and a number of critical considerations are discussed
