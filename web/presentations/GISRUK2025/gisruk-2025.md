Malleson, N., Quang, T. B., Nguyen Thi Thuy, H., Hoang Huu, P., Kieu, M., Asher, M., Wang, Y., & Comber, A. (2025, April 16). Using Large Language Models to Predict Neighbourhood Change. 33rd Annual GIS Research UK Conference (GISRUK), University of Bristol, UK. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15231204
Abstract: This paper uses a large-language model (LLM) to read user-contributed text data – in this
case property listings on Airbnb – and assign a score to indicate the degree to which the
property’s neighbourhood is potentially undergoing gentrification. Preliminary results for a
case study in Bristol are evaluated. These scores will ultimately be used as an input in a model
of dynamic spatio-temporal neighbourhood change with the aims of (i) quantifying the impact
that neighbourhood reputation has on historical house prices and (ii) predicting the emergence
of new house price bubbles.

Paper 2:
Comber, A., Asher, M., Wang, Y., Le Kieu, M., Quang, T., Nguyen Thi, H., Hoang Huu, P., & Malleson, N. (2025, April 15). Using house sales transactions data to identify potentially gentrifying neighbourhoods. 33rd Annual GIS Research UK Conference (GISRUK), University of Bristol, UK. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15225193
Abstract: This paper describes initial work seeking to identify locales of neighbourhood gentrification.
It summarises house sales transactions over MSOAs, compares average annual house price with
neighbouring areas over a 10 year period, and uses a time series analysis to identify
neighbourhoods with high rates of change of these as potential gentrifying neighbourhoods.
The next steps are to link to analyses of social media data to characterise the nature of the
observed neighbourhood change. A number of areas of further work are described and a
number of critical considerations are discussed
