_Comber, A., Asher, M., Wang, Y., Kieu, M., Bui, Q.T., Nguyen, T.T.H., Phe, H.H. and Malleson, N., 2025. Characterising neighbourhood dynamics through social media anlaysis and house sales transactions. AGILE: GIScience Series, 6, p.18._

**Abstract:** This paper describes a two stage approach for identify neighbourhood areas that may undergoing gentrification related changes. It summarises classic hedonic house price data over time (2014-2023) for each
neighbourhood, and compares neighbourhood average price with those of local nearby areas. This enables
neighbourhoods experience high relative increases in price to be identified as potentially gentrifying areas.
Social media data for these areas were extracted and analysed using a large language model and used to
score individual social media posts with the a measure of the degree to which their content indicates that the
neighbourhood is experiencing change, providing confirmatory evidence or not of gentrification. A number
of areas of further work are identified.
